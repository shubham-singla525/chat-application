# Goal
To learn how socket.io works!
# chat-application
The chat application works perfectly.
I used socket.io framework of js to 
make this real-time application
without even refreshing the browser.
By Default server runs on localhost:3000
# What is needed for project
npm script, node modules, express framework, nodemon, socket.io
# How to run
I use nodemon for running a server, to run this 
you simply write command npm run dev since I defined 
server name as dev.
# How to test
Simply run the server by writing above command
and open multiple tab in browser with localhost:3000
and simply enjoy chat.
